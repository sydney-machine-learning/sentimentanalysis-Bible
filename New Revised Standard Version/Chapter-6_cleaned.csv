verse
beware of practising your piety before others in order to be seen by them for then you have no reward from your father in heaven.
so whenever you give alms do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they may be praised by others. truly i tell you they have received their reward.
but when you give alms do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
so that your alms may be done in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you.
and whenever you pray do not be like the hypocrites for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners so that they may be seen by others. truly i tell you they have received their reward.
but whenever you pray go into your room and shut the door and pray to your father who is in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you.
when you are praying do not heap up empty phrases as the gentiles do for they think that they will be heard because of their many words.
do not be like them for your father knows what you need before you ask him.
pray then in this way our father in heaven hallowed be your name.
your kingdom come. your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
give us this day our daily bread.
and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.
and do not bring us to the time of trial but rescue us from the evil one.
for if you forgive others their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you
but if you do not forgive others neither will your father forgive your trespasses.
and whenever you fast do not look dismal like the hypocrites for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting. truly i tell you they have received their reward.
but when you fast put oil on your head and wash your face
so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your father who is in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you.
do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal
but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal.
for where your treasure is there your heart will be also.
the eye is the lamp of the body. so if your eye is healthy your whole body will be full of light
but if your eye is unhealthy your whole body will be full of darkness. if then the light in you is darkness how great is the darkness
no one can serve two masters for a slave will either hate the one and love the other or be devoted to the one and despise the other. you cannot serve god and wealth.
therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or what you will drink or about your body what you will wear. is not life more than food and the body more than clothing
look at the birds of the air they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them. are you not of more value than they
and can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life
and why do you worry about clothing consider the lilies of the field how they grow they neither toil nor spin
yet i tell you even solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these.
but if god so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven will he not much more clothe you you of little faith
therefore do not worry saying what will we eat or what will we drink or what will we wear
for it is the gentiles who strive for all these things and indeed your heavenly father knows that you need all these things.
but strive first for the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well.
so do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will bring worries of its own. today s trouble is enough for today.
