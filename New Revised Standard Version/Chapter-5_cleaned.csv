verse
when jesus saw the crowds he went up the mountain and after he sat down his disciples came to him.
then he began to speak and taught them saying
blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted.
blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth.
blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled.
blessed are the merciful for they will receive mercy.
blessed are the pure in heart for they will see god.
blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of god.
blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.
rejoice and be glad for your reward is great in heaven for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
you are the salt of the earth but if salt has lost its taste how can its saltiness be restored it is no longer good for anything but is thrown out and trampled under foot.
you are the light of the world. a city built on a hill cannot be hidden.
no one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket but on the lampstand and it gives light to all in the house.
in the same way let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father in heaven.
do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have come not to abolish but to fulfil.
for truly i tell you until heaven and earth pass away not one letter not one stroke of a letter will pass from the law until all is accomplished.
therefore whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
for i tell you unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and pharisees you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times you shall not murder and whoever murders shall be liable to judgement.
but i say to you that if you are angry with a brother or sister you will be liable to judgement and if you insult a brother or sister you will be liable to the council and if you say you fool you will be liable to the hell of fire.
so when you are offering your gift at the altar if you remember that your brother or sister has something against you
leave your gift there before the altar and go first be reconciled to your brother or sister and then come and offer your gift.
come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way to court with him or your accuser may hand you over to the judge and the judge to the guard and you will be thrown into prison.
truly i tell you you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.
you have heard that it was said you shall not commit adultery.
but i say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
if your right eye causes you to sin tear it out and throw it away it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
and if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell.
it was also said whoever divorces his wife let him give her a certificate of divorce.
but i say to you that anyone who divorces his wife except on the ground of unchastity causes her to commit adultery and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
again you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times you shall not swear falsely but carry out the vows you have made to the lord.
but i say to you do not swear at all either by heaven for it is the throne of god
or by the earth for it is his footstool or by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king.
and do not swear by your head for you cannot make one hair white or black.
let your word be yes yes or no no anything more than this comes from the evil one.
you have heard that it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
but i say to you do not resist an evildoer. but if anyone strikes you on the right cheek turn the other also
and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat give your cloak as well
and if anyone forces you to go one mile go also the second mile.
give to everyone who begs from you and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you.
you have heard that it was said you shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy.
but i say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
so that you may be children of your father in heaven for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous.
for if you love those who love you what reward do you have do not even the tax collectors do the same
and if you greet only your brothers and sisters what more are you doing than others do not even the gentiles do the same
be perfect therefore as your heavenly father is perfect.
